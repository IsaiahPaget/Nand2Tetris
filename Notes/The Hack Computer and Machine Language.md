A 16 bit computer refers to the fact that the bus is 16 bits meaning if you want to transfer data it always has to be in 16 bits for example if you want to send 8 to somewhere you have to send 0000000000001000

the machine consists of:
- Data Memory (RAM): a sequence of 16-bit registers
- Instruction memory (ROM): a sequence of 16-bit registers
- CPU: performs 16-bit instructions
- Instruction Bus / data bus / address buses: Image 16 lane highways that send data

Registers:
- A holds a value or an address
- M represents the ram register addressed by A -> the address being operated on
- D holds a value
